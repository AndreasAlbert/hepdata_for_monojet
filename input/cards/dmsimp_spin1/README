# DMsimp spin-1

In this case, there are six separate sample types: Monojet, mono-Z and mono-W, each with vector and axial couplings, respectively.
In order to get the full prediction for one parameter point, combine the three samples (monojet, mono-Z and mono-Z).

In addition to the typical cards, we also provide a cuts.f file that implements a madgraph-level cut on the pt of the DM pair system.
This cut allows to significantly enhance the generation efficiency with respect to the signal selection.
