# DMsimp t-channel

For each parameter point, we have split the signal generation into two parts:

1. Final state of two jets + DM pair from mediator pair production (PhiPhiToJJChiChi)

2. Final state of single jet + DM pair, where the jet is from QCD raidation (JChiChi)

the full signal prediction is simply the sum of the two samples. 
One might also generate them in a single sample for simplicity.
